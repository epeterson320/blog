or, one thing decided, or, in which I get skin in the game

Have you ever listened to NPR's _All Things Considered_? I did once.
I didn't like it. They should cancel that show and replace it with one
called _One Thing Decided_, hosted by a grouchy old man.

Tailwind calls itself a **utility-first** CSS framework. That's stupid.
If you're using components (React or server-side templating), you don't
want utility-first CSS. You want components. Utilities are a good thing,
but they are one abstraction level below components, so you're making work
for yourself if you aren't using a component library.

(Decision tree about when to use components vs utilities vs css modules).

Why not make a library with utilities and components together? That's a
good idea, and that's the essence of Bootstrap 4.

You don't need to choose one or the other. If you choose Bootstrap, you
get both.
