Thesis: A phone is better for you with less features than the average smartphone, and improving your phone is a self-control problem, not a technical problem.

Smartphones are too distracting.
A better phone would be a dumbphone, with just calling plus a few extra features.
How much would it cost to design and manufacture?
How much would it cost to engineer?
Is there a market for it?
Turns out, that's achievable with a smartphone if you disable the app store.
Turns out, this is a self-control problem, not a technical problem, therefore you can sidestep the business problems.
Crapware is still a problem. NFL Mobile is still on my phone.
