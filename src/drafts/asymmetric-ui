Three types of stacks: personal, social, and asymmetric.

Personal: Todoist

Social: Facebook, chat

Asymmetric: News, Starbucks, Uber

Most UI or full-stack tutorials demonstrate personal (TodoMVC) or Social 
(Firebase app) apps, but most of the work done, and value added by apps, is for
asymmetric work relationships. One person is a customer and another person is a server,
or manager vs employee, or author vs. reader. It's tough to show tutorials for these types
of relationships, however, since they're typically specific to a vertical, and require at
least twice as much work to explain and document.

Why aren't there more one-person SaaS products? Well there are a lot, but it's usually
because the apps that need to be built are for asymmetric relationships, and require
understanding of multiple user roles. Even with Starbucks, customer/PoS is an oversimplification.
Managers, business analysts, and supply chain folks need the same data in completely different
formats.
