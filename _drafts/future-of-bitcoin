Lay out the case for Bitcoin and the case against.

Against: Technical problems, expensive transaction costs, centralization.
For: Smart people have invested a lot into this, they have overcome a lot and will continue.

My take: They probably will be able to overcome these difficulties, but it will take longer than expected. Investing in bitcoin is like investing in Facebook in the 1960's. You'll eventually get rich, but you'll have to wait a while.
Investing in bitcoin requires knowledge of sociology, economics, technology, and now politics.

While the smart people could overcome these technical problems, other people will probably be able to overcome them with new crypto technologies more efficiently. Bitcoin runs the risk of becoming obsolete since new crypto tech doesn't require backward compatibility. Bitcoin's greatest strength is also its weakness. Many people are incentivized to keep backward compatibility, which will hold them back.
