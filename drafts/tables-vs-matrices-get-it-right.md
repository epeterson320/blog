Tables have 1 axis. they are a list.

Matrices have 2 axes. they are a many-to-many relationship.

There are lots of UI components for tables.
Link to them.

There are few or no UI components for matrices. I wish there were.
Link to d3.js.
Sometimes you show the same set on both axes, and their relationship. Les Miserables.
Sometimes you show different sets on each axis. This is called a bipartite graph. Teams and Players.

People, please learn the difference and know what you're working on, or
you're going to make a bad UI that I have to deal with.
