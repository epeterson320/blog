None of the other logs have been designed by the developer community.  Another reason is that logs have come a long way since 1999, when SAP released their function modules for the application log, and developers are used to a more concise syntax.  For instance, if I want to write to the console in javascript, it’s:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-javascript\\\"><code>console<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">log</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>‘The System is Down’<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>but in SAP, I have to declare 2 variables, then spend a page of code calling function modules BAL<em>LOG</em>CREATE, BAL<em>LOG</em>MSG<em>ADD, and BAL</em>DB_SAVE.  Part of the reason is that SAP has multiple logs, while a web browser only logs messages in one console.  So when you log anything in SAP, it must go to a specific application log object and sub-object.  Android (java) also writes to multiple logs.  Its logs are called with two arguments, tag and message, like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-java\\\"><code>Log<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">e</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>“SystemMsgs”<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> “The system is Down”<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>If logging in ABAP was going to be just as awesome (and I know it can be), what would it look like?  Please post your ideas and discuss!  Once enough good ideas are gathered, I’d like to start building something on github.  Anyone is welcome to contribute code or just ideas and insights.
