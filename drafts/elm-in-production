title: Elm in production: a mixed bag.
---

Elm is a really cool new-ish language I heard about on the Software Engineering Daily podcast
JSON deserializing was an intellectual joy. It was difficult, but I am a better programmer because of it.

Writing an effects library was too painful. Couldn't get a mouse wheel library working properly.
The need for a mouse wheel library wouldn't have been necessary if there was a good grid component. 
So I was held back by the lack of libraries too.

Since I was coming from a JS background, not Haskell or any other ML language, it was a great
experience to learn its syntax and see the strongest type safety I've ever seen so far.

The whole "Maybe" type is so verbose. It's a great idea but could be way simpler. Kotlin does
well with the elvis operator ?. but having to use "map" just seems pedantic.
