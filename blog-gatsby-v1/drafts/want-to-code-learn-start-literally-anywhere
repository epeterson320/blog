The path I took to learn how to code was the most random path ever.

SQL -> C++ -> VBA -> ABAP -> SQL in a good way -> Ruby -> HTML/CSS, which isn't even programming -> Javascript -> Android Java -> Scala -> Serious Javascript -> Kotlin -> Elm -> Scheme -> Haskell

That's not counting frameworks or markup languages.

I still don't know Python or PHP.

One word of advice: if something isn't working or programming just doesn't make sense, switch to a different curriculum. Don't assume this isn't for you.
