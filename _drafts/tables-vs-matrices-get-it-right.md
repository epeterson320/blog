tables have 1 axis. they are a list.

matrices have 2 axes. they are a many-to-many relationship.

There are lots of UI components for tables.
Link to them.

There are few or no UI components for matrices. I wish there were.
Link to d3.js.

People, please learn the difference and know what you're working on, or
you're going to make a bad UI that I have to deal with.
