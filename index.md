I'm Eric, and this is my website. It's hosted with GitHub.
Pages.

Here are some things I made:

* [Occam's Flashlight](
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.ericp.flashlight&hl=en
  ), the simplest possible Android flashlight.
* [Codeck](codeck), a tool to encode and decode a message
  in an ordered deck of cards.
