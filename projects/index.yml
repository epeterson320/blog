- name: ABAP Logger
  description: >-
    This is an open-source library I published when I was working with
    the ABAP programming language years ago. It needed a better way to
    log messages for further review, so I wrote a library to expose a
    more fluent interface for logging. As of March 2018, it's the third
    most starred ABAP project on Github.
