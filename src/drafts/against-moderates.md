Outline:

Moderation, at least in U.S. Politics, is no good.

Republicans and Democrats are becoming more extreme, people
say the solution is somewhere in the middle.

The average of poop and farts is sharts.

The average of first base and third base is the pitcher's mound.
What if the solution is second base or home plate? Have you seen
those diamond-shaped diagrams about the libertarians?
What is two dimensions is still too few to make a helpful metaphor
of U.S. politics? What if the solution isn't second base or home plate either?
What if it's 200 feet above the area
between left and center field? How do you compare renaissance
mercantilism, Noam Chomsky, neoliberalism, and Christian reformed
theonomy? What if 3 dimensions isn't enough for a good metaphor?
Political theory is a hyperspace. We need more dimensions.

Some dimensions aren't continuous like length and width.
Some dimensions are categorical, some are boolean, and the
yes-or-no questions require "and why?".
